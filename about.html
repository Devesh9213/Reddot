        <h2>Hi, I'm Your Name</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a professional photographer based in Berlin, passionate about telling stories through images. My journey began over a decade ago when I picked up my first camera and discovered the power of capturing fleeting moments. Since then, I’ve worked with couples, families and individuals to create images that are authentic and full of emotion.
        </p>
        <p>
          My style blends candid documentary with fine art. Whether it's the laughter shared at a wedding, the unique character revealed in a portrait or the tranquillity of the natural world, I aim to create photographs that stand the test of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not behind the camera, you’ll find me exploring Berlin’s vibrant neighbourhoods, travelling in search of new landscapes or experimenting with different creative mediums. I’m always excited to collaborate with new people and bring your vision to life.
